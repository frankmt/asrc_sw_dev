Your challenge is to write a simple dice game.
The game has two players who each roll a 6-sided dice.
The player with the highest roll wins!

You will make three classes:

1. Player
2. Game
3. Dice

The Dice class has the following methods:

* new

* roll
Returns a random number between 1 and 6... just like real dice :)

The Player class will have the following methods:

* new(name)
The method must take the player's name as an argument and store it in an instance variable.
You will need it to print out the winner's name.
It must also have a @latest_roll instance variable, which starts = 0.

* take_turn
The player rolls the dice.
You can create a new instance of the dice class, and call its 'roll' method.
The result is saved in the player's @latest_roll instance variable.

The Game class has the following methods:

* new(player1, player2)
These are saved in instance variables, @player1 and @player2.

* play
Both players take a turn.

* winner
Whichever player has the highest @latest_roll will win.

This should also output a sentence like:

"Mansoor won the game with a high roll of 6!"

Bonus: how will you handle a draw?
