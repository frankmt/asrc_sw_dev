#ASRC Software Development Training


This is the repository for all the code that will be written during our training. By committing code to the same place, we will be able to share what we are doing with each other, which will help us share the knowledge faster.

## Learn Ruby the Hard Way Exercises

For the first part of the training, please commit the code in the folder with your name, with each exercise in a separate folder, as in the example folder 'frankie'
